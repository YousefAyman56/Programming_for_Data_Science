This repository contains all projects did for Udacity Programming for Data Science Nanodegree Program.

## Overview
***
The Programming for Data Science with Python Nanodegree program offers the opportunity to learn the most important programming languages used by data scientists today. Get your start into the fascinating field of data science and learn **Python**, **SQL**, **terminal**, and **git** with the help of experienced instructors. You will emerge prepared to tackle.

## Course 1 : Introduction to SQL
***
The first course will teach you the fundamentals of SQL such as JOINs, Aggregations, and Subqueries. Learn how to use SQL to answer complex business problems.
### **Project 1 : Investigate a Database**

In this project, you’ll work with a relational database while working with PostgreSQL. You’ll complete the entire data analysis process, starting by posing a question, running appropriate SQL queries to answer your questions and finishing by sharing your findings.

## Course 2 : Introduction to Python Programming
***
In this part, you’ll learn to represent and store data using Python data types and variables, and use conditionals and loops to control the flow of your programs. You’ll harness the power of complex data structures like lists, sets, dictionaries, and tuples to store collections of related data. You’ll define and document your own custom functions, write scripts, and handle errors. You will also learn to use two powerful Python libraries - Numpy, a scientific computing package, and Pandas, a data manipulation package.
### **Project 2 : Explore US Bikeshare Data**
You will use Python to answer interesting questions about bikeshare trip data collected from three US cities. You will write code to collect the data, compute descriptive statistics, and create an interactive experience in the terminal that presents the answers to your questions.

## Course 3 : Introduction to Version Control
***
In this course, you will learn how to use version control and share your work with other people in the data
science industry.
### **Project 3 : Post your work on Github**
In this project, you will learn important tools that all programmers use. First, you’ll get an introduction to working in the terminal. Next,you’ll learn to use git and Github to manage versions of a program and collaborate with others on programming projects. In this project you will add a completed project on GitHub, work with branches, edit a README file and project files, merge branches, stage and commit your changes to your project GitHub repository.
